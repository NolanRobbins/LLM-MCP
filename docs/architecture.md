# AI Gateway MCP Server Architecture

## Overview

The AI Gateway MCP Server is a production-ready multi-provider AI gateway that provides intelligent routing, semantic caching, and cost optimization for AI model requests. It follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard and is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Run.

## Architecture Components

### 1. MCP Server (`server.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main entry point and MCP protocol implementation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle MCP tool calls
  - Coordinate between gateway components
  - Provide health checks and monitoring
  - Manage authentication and rate limiting

### 2. Intelligent Router (`gateway/router.py`)
- **Purpose**: Route requests to optimal AI providers
- **Key Features**:
  - Task classification (code, creative, reasoning, etc.)
  - Provider scoring based on requirements
  - Health monitoring and failover
  - Capability-based selection

### 3. Semantic Cache (`gateway/cache.py`)
- **Purpose**: Reduce costs through intelligent caching
- **Key Features**:
  - Embedding-based similarity matching
  - Configurable similarity thresholds
  - TTL-based expiration
  - FAISS for fast similarity search

### 4. Cost Optimizer (`gateway/cost_tracker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Track and optimize costs across providers
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time cost calculation
  - Usage analytics and reporting
  - Optimization recommendations
  - Cost prediction

### 5. Metrics Collector (`gateway/metrics.py`)
- **Purpose**: Monitor performance and health
- **Key Features**:
  - Request/response metrics
  - Provider performance tracking
  - Cache hit/miss rates
  - Health scoring

### 6. Rate Limiter (`gateway/rate_limiter.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manage request rates and quotas
- **Key Features**:
  - Per-user rate limiting
  - Adaptive limits based on load
  - Burst protection
  - Sliding window implementation

## Provider Integration

The gateway supports multiple AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Vision
- **Anthropic**: Claude-3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku
- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision
- **Mistral**: Medium, Small, Large models
- **Groq**: Mixtral, Llama2, Code Llama

## Caching Strategy

### Semantic Similarity
- Uses sentence transformers for embedding generation
- FAISS index for fast similarity search
- Configurable similarity thresholds (default: 0.95)
- TTL-based expiration (default: 24 hours)

### Cache Hit Optimization
- Embedding-based matching reduces false positives
- Model-specific caching for different capabilities
- Metadata filtering for targeted searches

## Cost Optimization

### Real-time Tracking
- Per-request cost calculation
- Provider and model breakdown
- User-level cost tracking
- Time-based analytics

### Optimization Recommendations
- Cheaper alternative suggestions
- Caching recommendations
- Usage pattern analysis
- Cost prediction

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collected
- Request latency and success rates
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Cost per request and provider
- Rate limiting statistics
- Provider health scores

### Health Monitoring
- Provider availability checks
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Automatic failover
- Performance degradation detection

## Security

### Authentication
- Cloud Run IAM integration
- API key management via Secret Manager
- User-based rate limiting
- Request validation

### Data Protection
- No persistent storage of user data
- Encrypted API communications
- Audit logging
- Privacy-compliant caching

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Cloud Run auto-scaling
- Stateless design
- Load balancing
- Container-based deployment

### Performance Optimization
